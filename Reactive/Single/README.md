The folders in this directory demonstrate various RxJava Single
features, as follows:

. ex1 - This example shows how to apply RxJava features synchronously
        to perform basic Single operations, including fromCallable(),
        map(), doOnSuccess(), and ignoreElement().

. ex2 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously using Single features in RxJava, including
        fromCallable(), subscribeOn(), map(), doOnSuccess(), and
        ignoreElement().

. ex3 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously and concurrently using more advanced Single
        features in RxJava, including fromCallable(), subscribeOn(),
        zipWith(), doOnSuccess(), and the parallel thread pool.
