# Getting Started

This example shows how to use the Spring WebFlux framework together
with Project Reactor to implement various types of backpressure
strategies (e.g., ignore, buffer, error, latest, drop, and push/pull)
between a publisher that runs as a micro-service in one process and
produces a flux stream of random integers and a subscriber that runs
in one or more threads in a different process and consumes this stream
of integers.  The following are the steps required to build and run
this WebFlux project.

1. Change directory to the Reactor/ex4 folder and run the following
   command from the shell:

   % mvn spring-boot:run

   This starts the Tomcat webserver by default on port 8080 and also
   starts the PublisherApplication.

   Conversely, this application can be run from within the Intellij by
   selecting run on the PublisherApplication.

2. Below are the end points to access the application via curl,
   postman, or any other Http/Java client (including web browers):
