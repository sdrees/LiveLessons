# Getting Started

This example shows how to use the Spring WebFlux framework together
with Project Reactor to process entries in a large recursive directory
folder concurrently as a web service.  The following are the steps
required to build and run this WebFlux project.

1. Change directory to the Folders/WebFlux folder and run the
   following command from the shell:

   % mvn spring-boot:run

   This starts the Tomcat webserver by default on port 8080 and also
   starts the FolderApplication.

   Conversely, this application can be run from within the Intellij by
   selecting run on the FolderApplication.

2. Below are the end points to access the application via curl,
   postman, or any other Http/Java client (including web browers):

   . Search count for a key at a given root directory using HTTP GET via

     http://localhost:8080/folders/works/_search?word=CompletableFuture

     You can pass any root director and Search word using HTTP GET via

     localhost:8080/folders/{rootDir}/_search?word=SomeWord&concurrent=true

   . Count entries recursively at a given root directory using HTTP
     GET via

     http://localhost:8080/folders/works/_count
     http://localhost:8080/folders/{rootDir}/_count

   . Getting recursive Dirent at a given root directory using HTTP GET via

     http://localhost:8080/folders/works/_create?memoize=false&concurrent=true
     http://localhost:8080/folders/{rootDir}/_create?memoize=false&concurrent=true
