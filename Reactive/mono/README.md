The folders in this directory demonstrate various Project Reactor Mono
features, as follows:

. ex1 - This example shows how to apply Project Reactor features
        synchronously to perform basic Mono operations, including
        fromCallable(), map(), doOnSuccess(), and then().

. ex2 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously using Mono features in the Reactor framework,
        including fromCallable(), subscribeOn(), map(), doOnSuccess(),
        and then().

. ex3 - This example shows how to reduce and/or multiply big fractions
        asynchronously and concurrently using more advanced Mono
        features in the Project Reactor framework, including
        fromCallable(), subscribeOn(), zipWith(), doOnSuccess(), and
        the parallel thread pool.
